# ZebrafishAquaticVisualStatsCode

This repository contains Matlab code for running the analyses described in the manuscript "Spatiotemporal visual statistics of aquatic environments in the natural habitats of zebrafish" By Cai et al. 

The dataset of terrestrial and aquatic videos should be downloaded separately from:

X

and the path should be manually updated in the code.

The repository is split into two parts:

## Contrast Analysis

This code runs the analyses of global and local contrast statistics (Figures 2, 3, and 5B/C). The script "main" sets the appropriate paths and calls a set of scripts to run each analysis, save plots, and report statistical tests.

## Fourier Analysis

This code runs the analyses of spatiotemporal statistics (Figures 4 and 5A). The script "main" sets the appropriate paths and calls a set of scripts to run each analysis, save plots, and report statistical tests.
